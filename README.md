In this work the micro-moment labeled anomalous power consumption dataset is used in this work and different pretrained models are used for classification. The instances are converted to images of size 224*224 so that they become compatible with the image size on which the pretrained models were trained. The model selection was based on the size and number of parameter of the model. Six pretrained models are used to perform the classification.
